## About the Project

For this project I created a README generator, using Node.js and the inquirer package. The app provides users with a series of prompts in the terminal, asking for information about their project. With the user responses, the program generates a markdown file, with sections and a table of contents dynamically built based on which elements the user chooses to include.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/natasha-mann/readme-generator.git
cd readme-generator
npm install
```
